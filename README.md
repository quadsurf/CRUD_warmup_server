# CRUD Warmup Server

This is the second part of a 3-part warmup series where you will build a de-coupled Full Stack App.

You'll be using express to create a JSON API, and you'll deploy the API to heroku.

# Getting Started

Fork/clone this repo. Make a pull request when finished.

### Generate an Express App

```
express .
```

Create a folder in the root called `api`

All of your CRUD endpoints will exist inside of the `api` folder.

### Connecting to your DB

* Copy the `knexfile.js` from your DB warmup into the root of this folder.
* Create a folder called db with a `knex.js` file inside that uses the connection information from `knexfile.js` and exports a connected instance of knex

### Signup

For the user table created in the DB warmup, you will only need a POST route to create a user:

Method: `POST`

Endpoint: `/auth/signup`
* Creates a user in the user table IFF a user with the given username does not exist in the DB.
  * Hash the password with bcrypt
* Responds with the ID of the user if the user was created.
* Responds with an error message and an error status code if the user is already in the DB.

### CRUD

Your API should include full CRUD routes for the other resources in your DB.

Each resource endpoint should begin with: `/api/resourceName`

* `GET` `/api/resourceName`
  * Respond with all rows in DB
* `GET` `/api/resourceName/:id`
  * Respond with a single row from DB
* `POST` `/api/resourceName`
  * Inserts a row into the DB with the data from the body of the request
* `PUT` `/api/resourceName/:id`
  * Updates a single row in the DB with the data from the body of the request
* `DELETE` `/api/resourceName/:id`
  * Deletes a single row in the DB

## Testing your API

You use a tool like `postman` to test your API endpoints.

## Document your API

* Document your API using [apidoc comments](http://apidocjs.com/)
* [Generate the HTML documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apidoc) and static serve from the root of your API
* Deploy!

# Deploy!

After deploying, update this readme with your deployed URL.
Go to the heroku dashboard and copy the git url from the heroku app you created in the DB warmup.

Add the heroku remote to this repo:

`git remote add heroku your-heroku-git-url-here`

Add/commit your changes, then push to heroku:

`git push heroku master`

# Stretch

## JWT Authentication

* Implement JWT Authentication - DO NOT use Passport
* Protect all routes with custom JWT middleware
* Update apidoc comments to include authentication instructions
